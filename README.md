# F.OFF.PDF
## _The Last PDF Generation Package, Ever_



F-OFF PDF is a PDF library for developers who are tired of struggling with JS-PDF, HTML2PDF or even Puppeteer.
Don't get me wrong, those tools are great, but when you are having random issues like white space at the top of the
page or the text is not wrapping correctly, you will understand the pain.

So without further ado, I present to you F-OFF PDF. A simple and easy to use PDF library that will make your life easier.
The library will eventually consume HTML and CSS to generate a PDF file.

The library is still in development, but you can follow the progress on Github.

## Features
- Convert a HTML file and watch it magically convert to PDF
